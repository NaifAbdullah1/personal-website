# Personal Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal website. This project is a showcase of my work, experience, and skills as a Full Stack Web Developer.

## Overview

The website is built with React and styled using SCSS, incorporating several advanced UI components and animations. It features a custom animated cursor, a loading screen, and smooth content transitions. The site includes various sections such as Hero, About, Experience, Portfolio, and Contact.

## Features

- **Animated Cursor:** Adds a custom animated cursor for a unique user experience.
- **Loading Screen:** Displays a loading screen before the main content is revealed.
- **Smooth Content Transition:** Implements a smooth fade-in effect for the website content after the loading screen.
